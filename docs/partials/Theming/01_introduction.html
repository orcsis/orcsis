<div class="doc-content theming">
    
    <p>Material Design is a visual language with specifications for innovative user experiences (UX) and user interface (UI) elements. Themes convey meaning through color, tones, and contrasts, similar to how Layouts convey meaning through keylines and alignments.</p>
<p>Theme <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-ui-color-palette"><strong>color palettes</strong></a>, alphas, and shadows deliver a consistent tone to your application and a unified feel for all Angular Material UI components.</p>
<p>Theming is integral to each Angular Material component, and theme construction is essential to the build process.</p>
<p>Currently, theming only affects colors and font family. Additional customizations such as font styles, padding, borders, and spacing are planned for future releases.</p>
